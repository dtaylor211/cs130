CS130 Project 4 - Design Document
=================================

Please answer all questions in this design document.  Note that the final
feedback section is optional, and you are not required to answer it if you
don't want to.

Unanswered or incompletely answered questions, or answers that don't actually
match the code/repository, will result in deductions.

Answers don't have to be deeply detailed!  We are mainly looking for an
overview or summary description of how your project works, and your team's
experiences working on this project.

Logistics (7 pts)
-----------------

L1.  [2pts] Enumerate all teammates here.


L2.  [2pts] What did each teammate focus on during this project?


L3.  [3pts] Approximately how many hours did each teammate spend on the project?


Spreadsheet Engine Design (31 pts)
----------------------------------

D1.  [3pts] Briefly describe the changes you made to the Lark parser grammar
     to support Boolean literals.
     

D2.  [4pts] Briefly describe the changes you made to the Lark parser grammar
     to support conditional expressions.  How did you ensure that conditional
     operations are lower precedence than arithmetic and string concatenation
     operations?


D3.  [6pts] Briefly describe how function invocation works in your spreadsheet
     engine.  How easy or hard would it be for you to add new functions to your
     engine?  What about a third-party developer?  How well does your code
     follow the Open/Closed Principle?


D4.  [4pts] Is your implementation able to lazily evaluate the arguments to
     functions like IF(), CHOOSE() and IFERROR()?  (Recall from the Project 4
     spec that your spreadsheet engine should not report cycles in cases where
     an argument to these functions does not need to be evaluated.)  If so,
     what changes to your design were required to achieve this?  If not, what
     prevented your team from implementing this?


D5.  [4pts] Is your implementation able to evaluate the ISERROR() function
     correctly, with respect to circular-reference errors?  (Recall from the
     Project 4 spec that ISERROR() behaves differently when part of a cycle,
     vs. being outside the cycle and referencing some cell in the cycle.)
     If so, what changes to your design were required to achieve this?  If
     not, what prevented your team from implementing this?


D6.  [4pts] Is your implementation able to successfully identify cycles that
     are not evident from static analysis of formulas containing INDIRECT()?
     If so, what changes to your design were required, if any, to achieve this?
     If not, what prevented your team from implementing this?


D7.  [6pts] Project 4 has a number of small but important operations to
     implement.  Comparison operations include a number of comparison and type
     conversion rules.  Different functions may require specific numbers and
     types of arguments.  How did your team structure the implementation of
     these operations?  How did your approach affect the reusability and
     testability of these operations?


Performance Analysis (12 pts)
-----------------------------

In this project you must measure and analyze the performance of features that
generate large bulk changes to a workbook:  loading a workbook, copying or
renaming a sheet, and moving or copying an area of cells.  Construct some
performance tests to exercise these aspects of your engine, and use a profiler
to identify where your program is spending the bulk of its time.

A1.  [4pts] Briefly enumerate the performance tests you created to exercise
     your implementation.


A2.  [2pts] What profiler did you choose to run your performance tests with?
     Why?  Give an example of how to invoke one of your tests with the profiler.


A3.  [6pts] What are ~3 of the most significant hot-spots you identified in your
     performance testing?  Did you expect these hot-spots, or were they
     surprising to you?


Section F:  CS130 Project 3 Feedback [OPTIONAL]
-----------------------------------------------

These questions are OPTIONAL, and you do not need to answer them.  Your grade
will not be affected by answering or not answering them.  Also, your grade will
not be affected by negative feedback - we want to know what went poorly so that
we can improve future versions of the course.

F1.  What parts of the assignment did you find highly enjoyable?  Conversely,
     what parts of the assignment did you find unenjoyable?


F2.  What parts of the assignment helped you learn more about software
     engineering best-practices, or other useful development skills?
     What parts were not helpful in learning these skills?


F3.  Were there any parts of the assignment that seemed _unnecessarily_ tedious?
     (Some parts of software development are always tedious, of course.)


F4.  Do you have any feedback and/or constructive criticism about how this
     project can be made better in future iterations of CS130?
