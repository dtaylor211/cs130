CS130 Project 5 - Design Document
=================================

Please answer all questions in this design document.  Note that the final
feedback section is optional, and you are not required to answer it if you
don't want to.

Unanswered or incompletely answered questions, or answers that don't actually
match the code/repository, will result in deductions.

Answers don't have to be deeply detailed!  We are mainly looking for an
overview or summary description of how your project works, and your team's
experiences working on this project.

Logistics (7 points)
--------------------

L1.  [2pts] Enumerate all teammates here.

    Benjamin (Ben) Juarez, Kyle McGraw, Dallas Taylor

L2.  [2pts] What did each teammate focus on during this project?

    Ben:    Performance improvement, design/code review
    Kyle:   Cell-change notifications, design/code review
    Dallas: Sorting regions of spreadsheets

L3.  [3pts] Approximately how many hours did each teammate spend on the project?

    Ben:    6
    Kyle:   9
    Dallas: 16

Spreadsheet Engine Design (10 points)
-------------------------------------

D1.  [4pts] Give an overview of how you implemented sorting.  Do you sort the
     rows directly?  Do you use adapter objects instead?  Some other technique?

    TODO @Dallas

D2.  [3pts] How does your implementation solve the problem of supporting the
     user-specified row ordering based on both the columns and the ordering to
     sort by?  Did you create any classes or functions to help specifically with
     this task?

    TODO @Dallas

D3.  [3pts] Briefly describe the changes you made to your spreadsheet engine to
     satisfy the stricter cell-change notification behaviors.  Did you find this
     to be largely straightforward to change?  Why or why not?

    TODO @Dallas @Kyle

Performance Improvement (13 pts)
--------------------------------

In this project you must improve the performance of operations that involve
bulk updating of cell formulas and/or values.  In the previous project your
team should have written some performance-testing code in preparation for this
effort, and should have run it under a profiler to get an initial sense of
where improvements can be made.  In this project you need to follow through on
this setup, and address performance issues in your code.

P1.  [7pts] Give a brief overview of 2-3 of the worst hot-spots you identified
     in your performance testing and analysis.  For each one, describe how your
     team was able to resolve it.

    TODO @Ben

P2.  [3pts] Did your team try anything to address performance issues and find
     that it didn't improve things at all?  If so, were you able to identify why
     the intended fix didn't produce the desired benefit?

    TODO @Ben

P3.  [3pts] Did your performance updates cause any regressions in functionality?
     If so, briefly describe any issues that emerged.  How were these issues
     identified (e.g. automated test failures, manual testing, etc.)?  How
     quickly were issues identified?

    TODO @Ben

Section F:  CS130 Project 4 Feedback [OPTIONAL]
-----------------------------------------------

These questions are OPTIONAL, and you do not need to answer them.  Your grade
will not be affected by answering or not answering them.  Also, your grade will
not be affected by negative feedback - we want to know what went poorly so that
we can improve future versions of the course.

F1.  What parts of the assignment did you find highly enjoyable?  Conversely,
     what parts of the assignment did you find unenjoyable?


F2.  What parts of the assignment helped you learn more about software
     engineering best-practices, or other useful development skills?
     What parts were not helpful in learning these skills?


F3.  Were there any parts of the assignment that seemed _unnecessarily_ tedious?
     (Some parts of software development are always tedious, of course.)


F4.  Do you have any feedback and/or constructive criticism about how this
     project can be made better in future iterations of CS130?
