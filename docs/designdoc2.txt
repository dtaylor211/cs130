CS130 Project 2 - Design Document
=================================

Please answer all questions in this design document.  Note that the final
feedback section is optional, and you are not required to answer it if you
don't want to.

Unanswered or incompletely answered questions, or answers that don't actually
match the code/repository, will result in deductions.

Answers don't have to be deeply detailed!  We are mainly looking for an
overview or summary description of how your project works, and your team's
experiences working on this project.

Logistics (7 pts)
-----------------

L1.  [2pts] Enumerate all teammates here.


L2.  [2pts] What did each teammate focus on during this project?


L3.  [3pts] Approximately how many hours did each teammate spend on the project?


Spreadsheet Engine Design (10 pts)
----------------------------------

D1.  [3pts] Briefly describe how your workbook-loading code operates.  Does
     it do anything sophisticated to optimize the performance of loading a
     workbook, such as deferring cell-value update calculations, or analyzing
     the graph of cell dependencies?


D2.  [3pts] Sheet-level operations like copying a sheet, deleting a sheet,
     renaming a sheet, or even creating a new sheet, can cause cell values
     to be updated.  How does your workbook identify such cells and ensure
     that they are updated properly?


D3.  [4pts] When renaming a sheet, cells with formulas that explicitly
     reference the renamed sheet must be updated with the new sheet name.
     Give an overview of how your implementation updates these formulas.


Spreadsheet Engine Code Review (17 pts)
---------------------------------------

R1.  [2pts] What part of your spreadsheet code-base did your team select to
     review?  Why did you select this portion of your code to review?


R2.  [2pts] Approximately how much code did your team review?  How much time did
     the meeting take?


R3.  [6pts] Include the list of action-items that were generated by the
     code-review here.


R4.  [3pts] Have you been able to address the action items identified?  If not,
     what is your plan and timeframe to do so?


R5.  [4pts] Reflect on whether the code review helped with knowledge-sharing in
     the team.  Do teammates feel more confident maintaining the code that was
     reviewed, and/or extending the code in the future?


Performance Analysis (16 pts)
-----------------------------

In this project you must measure and analyze the performance of two central
areas of your spreadsheet engine.  Using pair programming, construct some
performance tests to exercise these aspects of your engine, and use a profiler
to identify where your program is spending the bulk of its time.

A1.  [4pts] Briefly enumerate the performance tests you created to exercise
     your implementation, along with the teammates that collaborated to
     implement each of them.


A2.  [2pts] What profiler did you choose to run your performance tests with?
     Why?  Give an example of how to invoke one of your tests with the profiler.


A3.  [6pts] What are ~3 of the most significant hot-spots you identified in your
     performance testing?  Did you expect these hot-spots, or were they
     surprising to you?


A4.  [4pts] Reflect on the experience of pair-programming as you constructed
     these tests.  What went well with it?  What would you like to try to do
     better in the future?


Section F:  CS130 Project 2 Feedback [OPTIONAL]
-----------------------------------------------

These questions are OPTIONAL, and you do not need to answer them.  Your grade
will not be affected by answering or not answering them.  Also, your grade will
not be affected by negative feedback - we want to know what went poorly so that
we can improve future versions of the course.

F1.  What parts of the assignment did you find highly enjoyable?  Conversely,
     what parts of the assignment did you find unenjoyable?


F2.  What parts of the assignment helped you learn more about software
     engineering best-practices, or other useful development skills?
     What parts were not helpful in learning these skills?


F3.  Were there any parts of the assignment that seemed _unnecessarily_ tedious?
     (Some parts of software development are always tedious, of course.)


F4.  Do you have any feedback and/or constructive criticism about how this
     project can be made better in future iterations of CS130?
