CS130 Project 5 - Performance Improvement
=========================================

Improvement 1
-------------

Theory: Every major operation appears slower than expected, so there seems to be
a large underlying issue that we will try to identify in order to improve the
overall performance of our program. 

Rationale: After analyzing the profiler data associated with our performance 
tests, we seem to have located the issue such that our program spends a lot of 
time dealing with lark and loading the grammar.  More specifically, with a test
that simulates the LongChainUpdateBenchmark test, the cumulative time was almost
50 seconds which is too long.  We believe this is because each time we create a
cell, we load the lark grammar.  We can fix this by moving one line of code 
outside of the Cell __init__() in order to only load the grammar once.

Outcome: With this fix, the cumulative time with the same performance test drops
to about 8 seconds.  This performance improvement seems to have been applied 
across all major operations, as expected, after confirmation with other 
performance tests.  This fix alone will cause us to reach most of the benchmarks
for the peformance benchmark tests.  Yay we were right!
