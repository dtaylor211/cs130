CS130 Project Review
====================

Team performing review:  koala
Work being reviewed:  platypus

The first two sections are for reviewing the `sheets` library code itself,
excluding the test code and other aspects of the project.  The remaining
sections are for those other supporting parts of the project.

Feedback comments on design aspects of the `sheets` library
-----------------------------------------------------------

Consider the overall design and structure of the `sheets` library from
the perspective of the GRASP principles (Lecture 20) - in particular the
principles of high cohesion and low coupling.  What areas of the project
codebase are structured in a highly effective way?  What areas of the
codebase could be restructured to have higher cohesion and/or lower
coupling?  Give specific suggestions for how to achieve this in the code.

Feedback comments on implementation aspects of the `sheets` library
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Consider the actual implementation of the project from the perspectives
of coding style (naming, commenting, code formatting, decomposition into
functions, etc.), and idiomatic use of the Python language and language
features.  What practices are used effectively in the codebase to make
for concise, readable and maintainable code?  What practices could or
should be incorporated to improve the quality, expressiveness, readability
and maintainability of the code?

Feedback comments on testing aspects of the project
---------------------------------------------------

Consider the testing aspects of the project, from the perspective of "testing
best practices" (Lectures 4-6):  completeness/thoroughness of testing,
automation of testing, focus on testing the "most valuable" functionality vs.
"trivial code," following the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in individual tests,
etc.  What testing practices are employed effectively in the project?  What
testing practices should be incorporated to improve the quality-assurance
aspects of the project?

<your team's feedback here>

Consider the implementation quality of the testing code itself, in the same
areas described in the previous section.  What practices are used effectively
in the testing code to make it concise, readable and maintainable?  What
practices could or should be incorporated to improve the quality of the
testing code?
