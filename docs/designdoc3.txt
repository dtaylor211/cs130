CS130 Project 3 - Design Document
=================================

Please answer all questions in this design document.  Note that the final
feedback section is optional, and you are not required to answer it if you
don't want to.

Unanswered or incompletely answered questions, or answers that don't actually
match the code/repository, will result in deductions.

Answers don't have to be deeply detailed!  We are mainly looking for an
overview or summary description of how your project works, and your team's
experiences working on this project.

Logistics (7 pts)
-----------------

L1.  [2pts] Enumerate all teammates here.

     Benjamin (Ben) Juarez, Kyle McGraw, Dallas Taylor

L2.  [2pts] What did each teammate focus on during this project?

     Ben:      Functionality of copy/move cells
     Kyle:     Iterative graph function
     Dallas:   Linter

L3.  [3pts] Approximately how many hours did each teammate spend on the project?

     Ben:      11
     Kyle:     11
     Dallas:   10

Spreadsheet Engine Design (9 pts)
----------------------------------

D1.  [3pts] Moving and copying regions of a sheet are very similar operations,
     with only a few differences between them.  How did your team take advantage
     of the similarity of these two operations to reduce the amount of code
     required to provide this functionality?


D2.  [3pts] Similarly, moving/copying regions of a sheet, and renaming a sheet,
     both involve formula updates.  Was your team able to factor out common
     aspects of these two operations to reduce the amount of code required to
     implement these operations?  If so, what did you do?  If not, why not?


D3.  [3pts] How does your implementation address the challenges of moving or
     copying a region of cells where the source and target regions overlap?


Static Code Analysis / Code Linting (16pts)
-------------------------------------------

L1.  [5pts] The Project 3 spec includes an example of a subtle implementation
     bug with the Python counts(s, totals) function as written in the spec.
     Briefly describe the cause of the buggy behavior, and what is the
     recommended approach for avoiding the buggy behavior.


L2.  [4pts] What code-linter did your team use on your project?  Why did you
     choose it?  Was this the first CS130 project in which you used a linter?


L3.  [3pts] How did you automate the execution of your code linter?  Did
     everyone in your team find it easy to run?


L4.  [4pts] Did the use of the linter improve your overall code quality and
     correctness?  Give some specific details in your answer.  Were there any
     serious issues (e.g. buggy language idioms) you were unaware of?


Performance Improvement (18 pts)
--------------------------------

In this project you must improve the performance of two central areas of your
spreadsheet engine - cell updating and cycle detection.  In the previous project
your team should have written some performance-testing code in preparation for
this effort, and should have run it under a profiler to get an initial sense of
where improvements can be made.  In this project you will follow through on
this investigation, and fix performance issues in your code.

P1.  [7pts] Give a brief overview of 3-4 of the worst hot-spots you identified
     in your performance testing and analysis.  For each one, describe how your
     team was able to resolve it.


P2.  [4pts] Did your team try anything to resolve performance issues and find
     that it didn't improve things at all - perhaps even made things worse?
     If so, were you able to identify why the intended fix didn't produce the
     desired benefit?


P3.  [4pts] How do you feel that your performance updates affected your code's
     readability and maintainability?  Did it make it better? worse? unchanged?
     Elaborate on your answer.


P4.  [3pts] Did your performance updates cause any regressions in functionality?
     If so, briefly describe any issues that emerged.  How were these issues
     identified (e.g. automated test failures, manual testing, etc.)?  How
     quickly were issues identified?


Section F:  CS130 Project 3 Feedback [OPTIONAL]
-----------------------------------------------

These questions are OPTIONAL, and you do not need to answer them.  Your grade
will not be affected by answering or not answering them.  Also, your grade will
not be affected by negative feedback - we want to know what went poorly so that
we can improve future versions of the course.

F1.  What parts of the assignment did you find highly enjoyable?  Conversely,
     what parts of the assignment did you find unenjoyable?


F2.  What parts of the assignment helped you learn more about software
     engineering best-practices, or other useful development skills?
     What parts were not helpful in learning these skills?


F3.  Were there any parts of the assignment that seemed _unnecessarily_ tedious?
     (Some parts of software development are always tedious, of course.)


F4.  Do you have any feedback and/or constructive criticism about how this
     project can be made better in future iterations of CS130?
