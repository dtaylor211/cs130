CS130 Project 3 - Design Document
=================================

Please answer all questions in this design document.  Note that the final
feedback section is optional, and you are not required to answer it if you
don't want to.

Unanswered or incompletely answered questions, or answers that don't actually
match the code/repository, will result in deductions.

Answers don't have to be deeply detailed!  We are mainly looking for an
overview or summary description of how your project works, and your team's
experiences working on this project.

Spreadsheet Engine Design (9 pts)
----------------------------------

D1.  [3pts] Moving and copying regions of a sheet are very similar operations,
     with only a few differences between them.  How did your team take advantage
     of the similarity of these two operations to reduce the amount of code
     required to provide this functionality?

     We took advantage of this by creating helper functions (used by sheets)
     called get_source_cells() and get_target_cells().  For both moving and 
     copying, it is necessary to have access to the source cells in the source
     area and the target cells in the target/destination area.  Furthermore, 
     get_target_cells() calls get_shifted_contents() for each cell in order
     to apply shifts to formulas appropriately.  With all that said, these two
     helper functions handle most of the overlapping logic between moving
     and copying cells.  The only difference between the two is that 
     move_cells() has an extra few lines that sets the contents of the source 
     cells (not in the target area) to None.  Overall, we were able to reduce 
     the amount of code appropriately.


D2.  [3pts] Similarly, moving/copying regions of a sheet, and renaming a sheet,
     both involve formula updates.  Was your team able to factor out common
     aspects of these two operations to reduce the amount of code required to
     implement these operations?  If so, what did you do?  If not, why not?

     We did not address this specifically since our moving/copying cells
     calls set_cell_contents() which subsequently calls update_cell_values().
     Our rename_sheet() implementation also calls update_cell_values().  The 
     logic for updating formulas with moving/copying is held in 
     get_shifted_contents() (using regex) while the set_cell_contents() takes 
     in an optional argument for the new (renamed) sheet name and updates the 
     formula appropriately using regex.


D3.  [3pts] How does your implementation address the challenges of moving or
     copying a region of cells where the source and target regions overlap?

     We keep track of the locations/contents for source cells and target cells
     which means we don't have to worry about contents being inaccurately 
     changed before being copied.  Furthermore, we use .difference() to help 
     us determine the set of source cells that don't overlap with target cells
     before setting the source cell contents to None (for move_cells()).  This 
     ensures that we do not call update_cell_values() more than necessary.


Static Code Analysis / Code Linting (16pts)
-------------------------------------------

L1.  [5pts] The Project 3 spec includes an example of a subtle implementation
     bug with the Python counts(s, totals) function as written in the spec.
     Briefly describe the cause of the buggy behavior, and what is the
     recommended approach for avoiding the buggy behavior.

     If the totals dictionary is not given after counts() has been called with 
     some dictionary, then it will try to reaccess that same dictionary instead 
     of making a new one.  Basically, when counts() is evaluated with a 
     dictionary it saves it as the default dictionary.  The recommended approach 
     for avoiding this buggy behavior would be to use an immutable placeholder:
     
          def counts(s: str, totals: Dict[str, int] = None) -> Dict[str, int]:
               if totals is None:
                    totals = {}
               ...


L2.  [4pts] What code-linter did your team use on your project?  Why did you
     choose it?  Was this the first CS130 project in which you used a linter?

     We used pylint because of the strong recommendation based on its ability
     to catch both style issues and buggy usage issues.  We also selected this 
     linter because of its compatibility with make targets.  This was the first
     CS130 project in which we used a linter of any kind.


L3.  [3pts] How did you automate the execution of your code linter?  Did
     everyone in your team find it easy to run?

     We created make targets for difference executions of our code linter.  
     There are targets for testing individual files as well as bulk files.  We
     found this extremely easy to run.


L4.  [4pts] Did the use of the linter improve your overall code quality and
     correctness?  Give some specific details in your answer.  Were there any
     serious issues (e.g. buggy language idioms) you were unaware of?

     Yes, the linter certainly improved our overall code quality and 
     correctness.  For example, we did not have docstrings in any of our files 
     and in some functions.  We also realized that we were wasting some 
     computational resources by iterating over dictionary keys twice when doing 
     list comprehension with <Dict>.keys().  There were no major issues that we
     were unaware of.


Performance Improvement (18 pts)
--------------------------------

In this project you must improve the performance of two central areas of your
spreadsheet engine - cell updating and cycle detection.  In the previous project
your team should have written some performance-testing code in preparation for
this effort, and should have run it under a profiler to get an initial sense of
where improvements can be made.  In this project you will follow through on
this investigation, and fix performance issues in your code.

P1.  [7pts] Give a brief overview of 3-4 of the worst hot-spots you identified
     in your performance testing and analysis.  For each one, describe how your
     team was able to resolve it.

     Our two major hotspots were in set_cell_contents() and 
     update_cell_values().  Although these are only two hotspots, they were by 
     far the main contributors towards poor performance.  All other function 
     calls took less than 0.03 seconds.  For both hotspots, the main resolution
     was related to switching to an iterative graph algorithm and scc.  We 
     further addressed issues with set_cell_contents() when renaming sheets by
     getting a set of all cells to be updated instead of iterating through 
     parent's adjacency graphs (and potentially resetting the same cell more 
     than once).


P2.  [4pts] Did your team try anything to resolve performance issues and find
     that it didn't improve things at all - perhaps even made things worse?
     If so, were you able to identify why the intended fix didn't produce the
     desired benefit?

     Yes, we tried to improve speed of copying and moving cells by changing the
     call to set_cell_contents() of the copied/moved cells to be within the 
     sheet abstraction (rather than the workbook abstraction).  However, this
     did not speed things up significantly and it produced errors for cell 
     updating.  This occurred because we want to be able to handle updating 
     a cell in the case that a newly moved cell depends on another cell to be 
     moved that hasn't been set yet.


P3.  [4pts] How do you feel that your performance updates affected your code's
     readability and maintainability?  Did it make it better? worse? unchanged?
     Elaborate on your answer.

     Overall, it made things a lot better.  However, if you don't consider a 
     change to an iterative algorithm, then the only other aspect that improved 
     performance was essentially a simple bug fix.


P4.  [3pts] Did your performance updates cause any regressions in functionality?
     If so, briefly describe any issues that emerged.  How were these issues
     identified (e.g. automated test failures, manual testing, etc.)?  How
     quickly were issues identified?

     No, our performance updates did not cause any regressions in functionality
     (other than what was discussed in P2).  We know this is true from our 
     automated testing.


Section F:  CS130 Project 3 Feedback [OPTIONAL]
-----------------------------------------------

These questions are OPTIONAL, and you do not need to answer them.  Your grade
will not be affected by answering or not answering them.  Also, your grade will
not be affected by negative feedback - we want to know what went poorly so that
we can improve future versions of the course.

     what parts of the assignment did you find unenjoyable?


F2.  What parts of the assignment helped you learn more about software
     engineering best-practices, or other useful development skills?
     What parts were not helpful in learning these skills?


F3.  Were there any parts of the assignment that seemed _unnecessarily_ tedious?
     (Some parts of software development are always tedious, of course.)


F4.  Do you have any feedback and/or constructive criticism about how this
     project can be made better in future iterations of CS130?
